title: "Huong attends the Asian Science Camp in Japan"

Huong is thankful for her advisor at the time, Prof. Nguyen Ai Viet, for giving her an incredible chance to attend the [Asian Science Camp](https://www2.kek.jp/proffice/archives/feature/2009/ASC09.html) in Japan. The Assian Science Camp is like an asian version of the Lindau Nobel Laureate Meeting. She doesnot know that it is that "heavy". The trip is like an amazing dream: events happens so fast and so beautiful and so exotic (so many Nobel Lauriates with the best science achievements, so many new friends with different cultures, so many activities with new things to see, so many first-time moments...), but they are kind of blur (due to Huong's limitations of English at the time) and you would not even believe that they actually happened when you wake up (have I just met the real Emperor and Empress???).

One thing Huong knows for sure is that: she has changed. And her journey to foreign worlds of science begins...
