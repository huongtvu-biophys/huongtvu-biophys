Despite the on-growing [outbreak of MERS in Seoul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_Middle_East_respiratory_syndrome_outbreak_in_South_Korea), Huong flies to Seoul to attend the [Summer School on Polymers in Biology](http://home.kias.re.kr/MKG/h/summerschool2015/) at the Korea Institute for Advanced Study (KIAS). She considers this as one of the luckiest trips she has ever had. One of the lucks is to work in an increadible team and her team win an award for their outstanding group presentation.
