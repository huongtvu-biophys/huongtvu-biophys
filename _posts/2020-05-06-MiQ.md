Huong joins Anne Straube and other members in her lab to organize a new webinar series, [Motors in Quarantine Talks](https://mechanochemistry.org/whatson/MiQ/),  during the quarantine time. Being a super shy person, the series is a great chance for Huong to step out of her confort zones and be in front of 100+ people every week. Super nervous today, but it will get better.
