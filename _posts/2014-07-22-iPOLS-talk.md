Huong's first trip to Europe to present for the very first time in front of a big [international audience](https://www.cens.de/international/joint-workshops/ipols-2014/). Super super SUPER nervous. The journey is also incredibly adventurous, from how to obtain visaS, to almost be refused to board on the airplane at the last minute, to almost get drunk in Munich. She is thankful for [iPoLS](http://physicsoflivingsystems.org/) which helps her to grow a lot during her PhD training.
