Last year BPS meeting has been a blast. Huong is excited to attend another meeting with her new research results and manages to obtain a [Jacob K. Goldhaber Travel Grant](https://gradschool.umd.edu/funding/student-fellowships-awards/graduate-school-travel-grants) from the Graduate School to partially cover for her trip. 

Unfortunately, one day before the trip, she has to send her poster to the meeting without being there in person. One of her darkest nights... "Oh well, my BPS friends, see you in another year."
