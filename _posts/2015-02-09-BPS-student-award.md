Huong attends the Biophysical Society Meeting for the first time in Baltimore and enjoys every single moment of the meeting. One of the trips that she will keep talking about for a very very long time. She is so thankful for the helps she received from her friends, colleagues and professors to make it happen. It is like a wonderful dream. Even the sunset view out from the convention center on that day is incredibly beautiful.
