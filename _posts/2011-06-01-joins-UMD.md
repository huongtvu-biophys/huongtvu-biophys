Huong joins Dr. [Thirumalai's](https://sites.cns.utexas.edu/thirumalai) group (by then, at the [UMD](http://biotheory.umd.edu/)) as a PhD student. Her PhD research focuses on developing theoretical models (both analytical and computational) to analyze and interpret single molecule experiments. Her ultimated goal is to discover new general principles of biological motors using theoretical tools.
