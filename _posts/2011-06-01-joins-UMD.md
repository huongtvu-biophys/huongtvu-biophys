Huong joins Dr. [Thirumalai's](https://sites.cns.utexas.edu/thirumalai) group (by then, at the [UMD](http://biotheory.umd.edu/)) as a PhD student. Her PhD research focuses on developing theoretical models (both analytical and computational) to analyze and interpret single molecule experiments, in order to discover new general principles of biological motors.
